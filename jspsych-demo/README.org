* Serial recall online listening test based =jsPsych=

This is a serial recall task with numbers.  The web interface is based on https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych.

This is a demo version.  For server-side implementation use the =index.html=.  For local implementation use =index-local.html=.

The results are send and stored to https://formspree.io/.

The speech sound samples are from the Harvard Speech Corpus from Demonte (2019)[fn:speech].

** Demo version

- https://georgiosdiapoulis.github.io/jspsych-demo/index.html


** Code

The combination of auditory stimuli and flashing numbers was achieved by modifying the =jspsych-audio-keyboard-response= plugin.  The idea was to have a flashing =prompt=.

You can find the modified plugin in =jspsych/plugins/jspsych-audio-keyboard-response-flashing.js=.

The code below modifies the =prompt= and shows the numbers one-by-one.

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
if (trial.prompt !== null) {
    console.log("trial.prompt: ", trial.prompt);
    var arr = Array.from(trial.prompt);

    // Showing 1-by-1 numbers
    arr.delayedForEach(function(num) {
	console.log(num);
	display_element.innerHTML = '<div class="jspsych-blink" style="font-size:40px;">' + String(num) + '</div>';
    }, 1000, null, function() {
	console.log("done!");
    });

}
#+END_SRC


To make flashing intervals of show/non-show you modify the =jspsych/css/jspsych.css= file as follows.


#+BEGIN_SRC css
/* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16344354/how-to-make-blinking-flashing-text-with-css-3 */
.jspsych-blink {
    /* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function */
    /* This works somehow properly  */
    animation: blinker 1s step-start infinite;
}

/* https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/ */
@keyframes blinker {
    30% {
        opacity: 0;
    }
}
#+END_SRC



*** Formspree

To modify the submission form and button see: https://formspree.io/formbutton/docs


#+BEGIN_EXPORT javascript
formbutton("create", {
    action: "https://formspree.io/moqkrjpn",
    buttonImg: '<img src="https://img.icons8.com/cotton/64/000000/submit-document.png"/>',  // <-- new button icon
    onSubmit: myOnSubmit,
    fields: [{
	type: "email",
	name: "Thanks for participating!!<p>Please press the submit button to finish the experiment.</p>",
	required: false
    },
    {
	type: "submit"
    }]
})
#+END_EXPORT
